DYNAMO (DYNAmic MOdels) is a language developed in 1958 by Richard K. Bennet. Many version were developed during the years. This is a new python implementation of this simple but powerful simulation language.

I want to make a library that lets users to simulate system dynamics easily using the python  programming language as a basis.
